/**
 * When wishing to parallelize some transformation or action over elements that are received in a channel, there may
 * be some level of order that needs to be maintained within subsets of the elements that arrive.
 *
 * An example could be some *ETL* process in which the source of data provides values (ordered for a given key) for many
 * different keys. If the eventual sink for the elements needs quick delivery and strict time linear ordering of values
 * according to a given key then launching multiple coroutines to perform some action and then load their result cannot
 * guarantee order of delivery.
 *
 * One solution would be to filter at the source and have a separate job for each unique key. But if the number of
 * keys is large and evolves over time this process can be tricky to manage.
 *
 * An alternative solution would be to use some type of partitioning strategy to group the elements from the source into
 * subgroups (partitions) according to their key deterministically, maintain their original ordering, apply the desired
 * transformation or action and then merge the results back together as they are finished. This allows for concurrency
 * and a level of parallelization up to the maximum number of groups or that allowable by hardware architecture the
 * process is running on. This strategy can be useful on top of a partitioning strategy that is already present in a
 * given data source when the sources partition policy is not as fine grained as desired.
 *
 * [PartitionedMultiChannel] combined with [mapAndMergePartitions] allows for this pattern without having to keep track
 * of which [Channel] a given element should be sent to when provided with some lambda or implementation of a
 * [PartitionPolicy] (See [RoundRobinPartitionPolicy] for an example).
 *
 * When all default values are used, the result is essentially a single [Channel] with [Channel.RENDEZVOUS] capacity. */
